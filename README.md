# Julia's Jar ðŸŒŒ

### Project Description
Julia's Jar is an interactive wisdom generator inspired by Slammed series by Colleen Hoover. Users click the "Reveal Wisdom" button to receive random pieces of wisdom, with smooth animations, floating stars, and a cosmic background for a reflective experience. Perfect for moments when you need a little guidance or positivity!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Instead of searching aimlessly for advice, why not let a virtual jar provide random wisdom whenever you need it?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Julia's Jar: Click the "Reveal Wisdom" button, and let the jar reveal a random piece of wisdom, complete with animations, floating stars, and a calming cosmic vibe.
